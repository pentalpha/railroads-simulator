function WaitToStartOnRail():
	Wait for start message from the server
	IF(start message = "GOTO ID RAILX"):
		rail to start = RAILX
	ELSE:
		abort
	Set position to POS 0 of RAILX
	While not reached the end of the track:
		Advance train by speed
		Send message with position updated to server:
			"POS ID RAILX X"
				X = the new position
	Send message signaling that the train has reached the end of the track:
		"POS ID RAILX MAX"
	WaitToStartOnRail()


Train sends to the server a message to register itself:
	"REG ID RAIL1 RAIL2 RAIL3 RAIL4"
	ID = The train ID, any string
	RAIL1, RAIL2... = Sequence of rail tracks, the path for the train to follow.
	(all of the elements in the path must exist on the server, and they must form a closed cycle)
	Standart: The train starts on the first rail tracks in the list.
Train waits for an answer from the server, that can be:
	"ALLOW ID LENGTH1 LENGTH2 LENGTH3 LENGTH4"
		LENGTH1, LENGTH2 = The length of the rail tracks.
		Now, the train can start waiting for the message to start.
	"DENY ID"
		No deal, exit
WaitToStartOnRail()
